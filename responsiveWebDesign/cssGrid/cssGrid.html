<!-- Introduction to the CSS Grid Challenges
	CSS Grid helps us easily build complex web designs. It works by turning an HTML element into a grid Container with rows and columns for us to place children elements where we want within the grid.
-->

<!-- Create our First CSS Grid

	Turn any HTML element into a grid container by setting its `display` property to `grid`. This gives us the ability to use all the other properties associated with CSS Grid.


	Note
	In CSS Grid, the parent element is referred to as the container and its children are called items.



-->

<!-- Add Columns with grid-template-columns
	Simply creating a grid element doesn't get us very far. We need to define the structure of the grid as well. To add some columns to the grid, use the `grid-template-columns` property on a grid container as demonstrated below: 
		```
		.container{
		display: grid;
		grid-template-columns: 50px 50px;
		}
		```

	This will give our grid two columns that are 50px wide each.

	The number of parameters gives to the `grid-template-columns` property indicates the number of columns in the grid, and the value of each parameter indicates the width of each column.


-->

<!-- Add Rows with grid-template-rows 
	The grid we created in the last challenge will set the number of rows automatically. To adjust the rows manually, use the `grid-template-rows` property in the same way we use `grid-template-columns` in previous challenge.
-->

<!-- Use CSS Grid units to change the size of columns and rows

	We can use absolute and relative units like `px` and `em` in CSS Grid to define the size of rows and columns. We can use these as well:

	`fr`: sets the column or row to a fraction of available space,

	`auto`: sets the column or row to the width or height of its content automatically,

	`%`: adjust the column or row to the percent width of its container.


	Here's the code that generates the output in the preview:

	```
	grid-template-columns: auto 50px 10% 2fr 1fr;
	```

	This snippet creates five columns. The first column is as wide as its content, the second column is 50px, the third column is 10% of its container, and for the last two columns; the remaining space is divided into three sections, two are allocated for the fourth column, and one for th fifth. 
-->


<!-- Create a Column Gap using grid-column-gap

	So far in the grids we have created, the columns have all been tight up against each other. Sometimes we want a gap between the columns. To add a gap between the columns, use the `grid-column-gap` property like this:

	```
	grid-column-gap: 10px;
	```

	This creates 10px of empty space between all of our columns.

 -->

<!-- Create a Row Gap using grid-row-gap 

	We can add a gap in between the rows of a grid using `grid-row-gap` in the same way that we added gap in between column in the previous challenge.

	```
	grid-row-gap: 5px;
	```

-->


<!-- Add Gaps Faster with grid-gap

`grid-gap` is a shorthand property for `grid-row-gap` and `grid-column-gap` from the previous two challenges that's more convenient to use. If `grid-gap` has one value, it will create a gap between all rows and columns. However, if there are two value, it will use the first one to set the gap between the rows and the second valuefor the columns.
 -->


<!--  Use grid-column to control spacing

	Up to this point, all the properties that have been discussed are from grid containers. The `grid-column` property is the first one for use on the grid items themselves.

	The hypothetical horizontal and vertical lines that create the grid are referred to as lines. These lines are numbered starting with 1 at the top left corner of the grid and move right for columns and down for rows, counting upward.


	To control the amount of columns an item will consume, we can use the `grid-column` property in conjunction witht the line numbers we want the item to start and stop at.

	Here's an example:

	```
		grid-column: 1/3;
	```

	This will make the itme start at the first vertical line of the grid on the left and span to the 3rd line of the grid, consuming two columns.



-->
<!-- Use grid-row to Control Spacing 
	Of Course, we can make items consume multiple rows just like you can with columns. You define the horizontal lines we want an item to start and stop at using the `grid-row` property on a grid item.
