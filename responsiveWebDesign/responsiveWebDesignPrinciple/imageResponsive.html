<!-- Make an Image Responsive
	Making images responsive with CSS is actually very simple. Instead of applying an absolute width to an element:

	```
	img {width: 720px; }
	```
	We can use:

	```
		img{
			max-width: 100%;
			display: block;
			height: auto;
		}
	```
	The max-width property of 100% scales the image to fit the width of its container, but the image won't stretch wider than its original width. Setting the `display` property to block changes the image from an inline element (its default), to a block element on its own line. The height property of auto keeps the original aspect ratio of the image.

 <style>
 	img {
 		max-width: 100%;
 		display: block;
 		height: auto;
 	}
  
</style>
