<!-- Introduction to the Responsive Web Design Challenges

Today, there are many types of devices that can access the web. They range from large desktop computers to small mobile phones. These devices have different screen sizes, resolutions, and processing power. Responsive Web Design is an approach to designing web content that responds to the constraints of different devices. The page structure and CSS rules should be flexible to accommodate these differences. In general, design the page's CSS to your target audience. If you expect most of your traffic to be from mobile users, take a 'mobile-first' approach. Then add conditional rules for larger screen sizes. If your visitors are desktop users, then design for larger screens with conditional rules for smaller sizes. CSS gives you the tools to write different style rules, then apply them depending on the device displaying the page. This section will cover the basic ways to use CSS for Responsive Web Design.

 Create a Media Query
Media Queries are a new technique introduced in CSS3 that chnage the presentation of content based on different viewpoint sizes. The viewport is a user's visible area of a web page, and is different depending on the site.

Media Queries consist of a media type, and if that media type matches the type of device the document is displayed on, the styles are applied. We can have as many selectors and styles inside our media query as we want.

Here's an example of a media query that returns the content when the content device's width is less than or equal to 100px:

```
	@media (max-width: 100px)
	{/*CSS Rules*/}
```

and the following media query returns the content when the device's height is more than or equal to 350px:


```
	@media (min-height: 350px)
	{/*CSS Rules*/}
``` 

Remember, the CSS inside the media query is applied only if the media type matches that of the device being used.

<style>
  p {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
  
  /* Add media query below */
  @media (max-height: 800px){
    p {
      font-size: 10px;
    }
  }
  
</style>
