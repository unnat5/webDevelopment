<!-- Use a Retina Image for Higher Resolution Display.

The simplest way to make our images appear "retina" (and optimize them for retina displays) is to define their `width` and `height` values as only half of what original file is.

Here is an example of an image that is only using half of the original height and width:

```
<style>
	img {height: 250px;
		width: 250px;
	}
</style>

<img src="coolPic500x500" alt="A most excellent picture">
```


 -->

 <style>
  img{
  	height: 100px;
  	width: 100px;
  }
</style>
