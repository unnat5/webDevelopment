<!-- Introduction to the CSS Flexbox Challenges

A website's User Interface ("UI") has two components. First, there are the visual elements, such as colors, fonts, and images. Second, there is the placement or positioning of those elements. In Responsive Web Design, a UI layout must accommodate many different browsers and devices accessing the content.

CSS3 introduced Flexible Boxes, or flexbox, to create page layouts for a dynamic UI. It is a layout mode that arranges elements in a predictable way for different screen sizes and browsers. While somewhat new, all popular modern browsers support flexbox. This section covers how to use flexbox and the different layout options it offers.

<!-- flex to position two boxes

This section uses alternating challenge styles to show how to use CSS to position elements in a flexible way. First, a challenge will explain theory, then a practical challenfe using a simple tweet component will apply the flexbox concept.

Placing the CSS property `display: flex;` on an element allows us to use other flex properties to build responsive page.

<!-- Use the flex-direction Property to Make a Row

	Adding `display: flex` to an element turns it into a flex container. This makes it possible to align any children of that element into rows or columns. We do this by adding the `flex-direction` property to the parent item and setting it to row or column. Creating a row will align the children horizontally, and creating a column will align the children vertically.

	Other options for `flex-direction` are row-reverse and column-reverse.
	options are
	1. row (default)
	2. column
	3. row-reverse
	4. column-reverse

	Note
	The default value for the `flex-direction` property is row.

 <!-- Use the flex-direction to make column

	The last challenges used the `flex-direction` property set to row. This property can also create column by vertically stacking the children of a flex container.

<!-- Align Elements using the justify-content property

	Sometimes the flex items within a flex container do not fill all the space in the container. It is common to want to tell CSS how to align and  space out the flex items a certain way. Fortunately, the `justify-content` property has several options to do this. But first, there is some important teminology to understand before reviewing those options.

	Recall that setting a flex container as a row places the flex items side by side from left to right. A flex container set as a column places the flex items in a vertical stack from top-to-bottom. For each, the direction the flex items are arranged is called the *main axis*. For a row, this is a horizontal line that cuts through each item. And for a column, the main axis is a vertical line through the items. And for a column, the amin axis is a vertical line through the items.

	There are several options for how to space the flex items along the line that is the main axis. One of the most commonly used is

	`justify-content: center;`, which aligns all the flex items to the center inside flex container. Other options include:

	- `flex-start`: aligns items to the start of the flex container. For a row, this pushes the items to the left of the container. For a column, this pushes the items to the top of the container.
	
	- `flex-end`: aligns items to the end of the flex container. For a row, this pushes the items to the right of the container. For a column, this pushes the items to the bottom of the container.

	- `space-between`: aligns items to the center of the main axis, with extra space placed between the items. The first and last items are pushed to the very edge of the flex container. For example, in a row the first item is against the left side of the container.For example, in a row the first item is against the left side of the container, the last item is against the right side of the container, the last item is against the right side if the container, the the other items between them are spaced evenly.

	- `space-around:`similar to `space-between` but the first and last items are not locked to the edges of the container, the space is distributed around all the items
