<!-- ## Adjust the Padding of an Element 

	Now let's put our Cat Photo App away for a little while and learn more about styling HTML.

	We may have already noticed this, but all HTML elements are essentially little rectangles.

	Three important properties control th space that surrounds each HTML element: `padding,margin`and `border.`

	An element's `padding` controls the amount of space between the element's content and its `border`.

	Here, we can see that the blue box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. Note that the red box has more `padding` than the blue box.

	When we increase the blue box's `padding`, it will increase the distance(`padding`) between the text and the border around it.

<!-- ## Adjust the Margin of an Element

	An element's `margin` controls the amount of space between an element's `border` and surrounding elements.

	Here, we can see that the blue box and the red box are nested within the yellow box. Note that the red box has bigger margin than the blue box, making it appear smaller.

	When we increase the blue box's `margin`, it will increase the distance between its border and surrounding elements.

 <!-- ## Add Negative Margin to an Element

 An element's margin controls the amount of space between element's border and surrounding elements.

 If we set an element's margin to a negative value, the element will grow larger.

  <!-- ## Add Different Padding to Each Side of an Element

  	Sometimes we will want to customize an element so that it has different amounts of padding on each of its sides.

  	CSS allows us to control the padding of all four individual sides of an element with the padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left properties.

<!-- ## Add Different Margins to Each side of Element
	Sometimes you will want to customize an element so that it has a different margin on each of its sides.

	CSS allows you to control the `margin` of all four individual sides of an element with the `margin-top`,`margin-right`,`margin-bottom` and `margin-left` properties.

 <!-- ## Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Padding of an Element 
	Instead of specifying an element's `padding-top`,`padding-right`, `padding-bottom` and `padding-left` properties individually, we can specify them all in one line, like this:

	```
	padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;
	```

	These four values work like a clock: top, right, bottom, left, and will produce the exact same result as using the side-specific padding instructions.

  <!-- ## Use Clockwise Notation to Specify the Margin of an Element

  Let's try this again, but with margin this time.

  Instead of specifying an element's margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left properties individually, you can specify them all in one line, like this:

margin: 10px 20px 10px 20px;

These four values work like a clock: top, right, bottom, left, and will produce the exact same result as using the side-specific margin instructions.

 <!-- ## Understand Absolute versus Relative Units

 The last several challenges all set an element's margin or padding with pixels(`px`). Pixels are a type of length unit, which is what tells the browser how to size or space an item. In addition to `px`, CSS has a number of different length unit options that we can use.

 The two main types of length units are absolute and relative. Absolute units tie to physical units of length. For example, `in` and `mm` refer to inches and millimeters, respectively. Absolute length units approximate the actual measurement on a screen, but there are some differences depending on a screen's resolution.

 Relative units, such as `em` or `rem`, are relative to another length value. For example, `em` is based on the size of an element's font. If we use it to set the `font-size` property itself, it's relative to the parent's `font-size`.


 ## Note 
 There are several relative unit options that are tied to the size of the viewport. They are covered in the Responsive Web Design Principles section.
