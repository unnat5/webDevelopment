<!-- Avoid Colorblindness issues by carefully choosing colors that convey information

There are various forms of colorblindness. These can range from a reduced sensitivity to a certain wavelength of light to the inability to see color at all. The most common form is a reduced sensitivity to detect greens.

For example, if two similar green colors are the foreground and background color of our content, a colorblind user may not be able to distinguish them. Close colors can be thought as neighbors on the color wheel, and those combination should be avoided when conveying important information.

Note
Some online color picking tools include visual simulation of how color appear for different types of colorblindness. There are great resources in addition to online contrast checking calculators.
