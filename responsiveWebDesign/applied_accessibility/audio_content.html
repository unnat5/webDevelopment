<!-- Improve Accessibilty of Audio content with the audio element 
	HTML5's `audio` element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in our markup. Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.

	The `audio` tag supports the `controls` attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls and supports keyboard functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on.

	Here's an example:

	```
		<audio id="meowClip" controls>

			<source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/>
			<source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg"/>

		</audio>


	```

	Note
	Multimedia content usually has both visual and auditory components. It needs synchronized captions and a transcript so users with visual and/or auditory impairments can access it. Generally,a web developer is not responsible for creating the captions or transcript, but needs to know to include them.
