<!--Give Links Meaning by using Descriptive Link text  

	Screen reader users have different options for what type of content their device reads. This includes skipping to (or over) landmark elements, jumping to main content, or getting a page summary from headings. Another option is to only hear the links available on a page.

	Screen readers do this by reading the link text, or what's between the anchor(`a`) tags. Having a list of "click here" or "read more" links isn't helpful isn't helpful. Insteadm we should user brief but descriptive text within a `a` tags to provide more meaning for these users.
