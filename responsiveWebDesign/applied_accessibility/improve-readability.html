<!-- Improve Readability with High Contrast Text
	Low contrast between the foreground and backgroudn colors can make text difficult to read. Sufficient contrast improves te readability of our content, but what exactly does "sufficient" mean?

	The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) recommend at least a 4.5 to 1 contrast ratio for normal text. The ratio is calculated by comparing the relative luminance values of two colors. This ranges from 1:1 for the same color, or no contrast, to 21:1 fro white against black, the strongest contrast. There are many contrast checking tools available online that calculate this ratio for us.

 <!-- Avoid Colorblindness Issues by using sufficient contrast
	Color is a large part of visual design, but its use introduces two accessibility issues. First, color alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information because screen reader users won't see it. Second, foreground and background colors need sufficient contrast so colorblind users can distinguish them.

	Previous challenges covered having text alternatives to address the first issue. The last challenge introduced contrast checking tools to help with the second. The WCAG-recommended contrast ratio of 4.5:1 applies for color use as well as gray-scale combinations.

	Colorblind users have trouble distinguishing some colors from others- usually in hue but sometimes lightness as well. We may recall the contrast ratio is calculated using the relative luminance (or lightness) values of the foreground and background colors.

	In practice, the 4.5:1 ratio can be reached by darkening the darker color and lightening the ligher one with the aid of a color contrast checker. Darker colors on the color wheel are considered to be blues, voilets, magentas, and reds, whereas lighter colors are oranges, yellows, greens, and blue-greens.

 		<h2>A Word on the Recent Catnip Doping Scandal</h2>
 		<p>The influence that catnip has on feline behavior is well-documented, and its use as an herbal supplement in competitive ninja circles remains controversial. Once again, the debate to ban the substance is brought to the public's attention after the high-profile win of Kittytron, a long-time proponent and user of the green stuff, at the Claw of Fury tournament.</p>
 		<p>As I've stated in the past, I firmly believe a true ninja's skills must come from within, with no external influences. My own catnip use shall continue as purely recreational.</p>
