<!-- Make Screen Reader Navigation easier with the header landmark

	The next HTML5 element that adds semantic meaning and improves accessibility is the `header` tag. It's used to wrap introductory infromation or navigation links for its parent tag, and works well around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages.


	`header` shares the embedded landmark feature we saw with `main`, allowing assistive technologies to quickly navigate to that content.


	Note
	
	`header` is meant for use in the `body` tag of our HTML document. This is different than the `head` element, which contains the page's title, meta information,etc.

 -->

 <!-- Make Screen Reader navigation easier with the nav landmark
	The `nav` element is another HTML5 item with the embedded landmark feature for easy screen reader navigation. This tag is meant to wrap around the main navigation links in our page.

	If there are repeated site links at the bottom of the page, it isn't necessary to markup those with a `nav` tag as well. Using a `footer (covered in the next challenge) is sufficient. `

<!-- Make Screen Reader Navigation Easier with the footer Landmark

	Similar to `header` and `nav`, the `footer` element has a built-in landmark feature that allows assistive devices to quickly navigate to it. It's primarily used to contain copyright information or links to related documents that usually sit at the bottom of a page.

 <!-- Improve Accessibilty of Audio content with the audio element 
	HTML5's `audio` element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in our markup. Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript.

	The `audio` tag supports the `controls` attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls and supports keyboard functionality. This is a boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on.

	Here's an example:

	```
		<audio id="meowClip" controls>

			<source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"/>
			<source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg"/>

		</audio>


	```

	Note
	Multimedia content usually has both visual and auditory components. It needs synchronized captions and a transcript so users with visual and/or auditory impairments can access it. Generally,a web developer is not responsible for creating the captions or transcript, but needs to know to include them.




 -->
<!-- Improve Chart Accessibility with the figure Element
	HTML5 introduced the `figure` element, along with the related `figcaption`. Used together, these items wrap a visual representation (like an image, diagram, or chart) along with its caption. This gives a two-fold accessibility boost by both semantically grouping related content, and providing a text alternative that explains the figure.

	For data visualization like charts, the caption can be used to briefly note the trends or conclusions for users with visual impairements. Another challenge covers how to move a table version of the cart;s data off-screen (using CSS) for screen reader users.


	Here's an example - note that the `figcaption` goes inside the `figure` tags and can be combined with other elements:

	```
	<figure>
		<img src="roundhouseDestruction.jpeg" alt="Photo of Camper Cat executing a roundhouse kick">
		<br>
		<figcaption>
			Master Camper Cat demonstrates proper from of a roundhouse kick
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	```

<!-- Make Elements only visible to a screen reader by using custom css

Have we noticed that all of the applied acessibility challenges so far haven't used any CSS? This is to show the importance of a logical document outline, and using semantically meaningful tags around our content before introducing the visual design aspect.

However, CSS's magic can also improve accessibility on our page when want to visually hide content meant only for screen readers. This happens when information is in a visual format (like a chart), but screen reader users need an alternatice presentation (like a table) to access the data. CSS is used to position. the screen reader - only elements off the visual area of the browser window.


Here's an example of the CSS rules that accomplish this:
```
	.sr-only{
		position: absolute;
		left: -10000px;
		width: 1px;
		height: 1px;
		top: auto;
		overflow: hidden;
	}
```

Note
The following CSS approaches will NOT do the same thing:

- `display: none;` or `visibility: hidden;` hides content for everyone, including screen reader users

- Zero values for pixel sizes, such as `width: 0px; height:0px;` removes that element from the flow of our document, meaning screen readers will ignore it.

  <style type="text/css">

  		/*nav li {
		display: inline;
		margin-right: 20px; 
	}*/

	.sr-only{
		position: absolute;
		left: -10000px;
		width: 1px;
		height: 1px;
		top: auto;
		overflow: hidden;
	}
  </style>
