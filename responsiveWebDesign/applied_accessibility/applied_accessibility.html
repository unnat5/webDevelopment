<!-- Introduction to the Applied Accessibility Challenges

Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. Websites should be open and accessible to everyone, regardless of a user's abilities or resources. Some users rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader or voice recognition software. Other users may be able to navigate through a site only using a keyboard. Keeping the needs of various users in mind when developing your project can go a long way towards creating an open web. Here are three general concepts this section will explore throughout the following challenges:

1. have well-organized code that uses appropriate markup
2. ensure text alternatives exist for not-text and visual content
3. create an easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly.


Having accessible web content is an ongoing challenge. A great resource for your projects going forward is the W3 Consortium's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). They set the international standard for accessibility and provide a number of criteria you can use to check your work.

 <!-- Add a text alternative to images for visually Impaired accessibility 

	It's likely we've seen an `alt` attribute on an `img` tag in other challenges. `alt` text describes the content of the image and provides a text-alternative. This helps in case the image fails to load or can;t been seen by a user. It's also used by search engines to understand what an image contains to include it in search results. Here's an example:

	```
	<img src="importantLogo.jpeg" alt="Company logo">
	```

	People with visual impairments rely on screen readers to convert web content to an audio interface. They won't get information if it's only presented visually. For images, screen readers can access the alt attribute and read its contents to deliver key information.

	Good alt text is short but descriptive, and meant to briefly convey the meaning of the image. You should always include an alt attribute on your image. Per HTML5 specification, this is now considered mandatory.
 -->

 <!--  Know when alt text should be left blank
	In the last challenge, you learned that including an alt attribute on img tags is mandatory. However, sometimes images are grouped with a caption already describing them, or are used for decoration only. In these cases alt text may seem redundant or unnecessary.

	In situations when an image is already explained with text content, or does not add meaning to a page, the img still needs an alt attribute, but it can be set to an empty string. Here's an example:

	```
		<img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt="">
	```

	Background images usually fall under the 'decorative' label as well. However, they are typically applied with CSS rules, and therefore not part of the markup sceen readers process.

	Note
	For images with a caption, we may still want to include `alt` text, since it helps search engines catalog the content of the image.

 <!-- Use Headings to show hierarchical relationships of content

Headings (`h1` through `h6` elements) are workhorse tags that help provide structure and labeling to our content.  Screen readers can be set to read only the headings on a page sot the user gets a summary. This means it is important for heading tags in our markup to have semantic meaning and relate to each other, not be picked merely for their size values.

Semantic meaning means that the tag we use around content indicates the type of information it contains.


If we were writing a paper with an introduction, a body, and a conclusion, it wouldn't make much sense to put the conclusion the conclusion as a subsection of the body in our outline. It should be its own section. Similarly, the heading tags in a webpage need to go in order and indicate the hierarchical relationship of our content.

Heading with equal (or higher) rank start new implied sections, headings with lower rank start subsections of the previous one.

As an example, a page with an `h2` element followed by several subsections labeled with `h4` tags would confuse a screen reader user.With six choices, it's tempting to use a tag because it looks better in a browser, but we can use CSS to edit the relative sizing.

One final point, each page should always have one (and only one) `h1` element, which is the main subject of our content. This and the other headings are used in part by search engines to understand the topic of the page.
-->


<!-- Jump Straight to the content using the main element

	HTML5 introduced a number of new elements that give developers more options while also incorporating accessibilty features. These tags include `main`, `header`, `footer`, `nav`,`article`, and `section`, among others.

	By default, a browser renders these elements similarly to the humble `div`. However, using them where appropriate gives additional meaning in our markup. The tag name alone can indicate the type of information it contains, which adds semantic meaning to that content. Assistive technologies can access this information to provide better page summary or navigation options to their users.

	The `main` element is used to wrap (we guessed it) the main content, and there should be only one per page. It's meant to surround the information that's related to the central topic of our page. It's not mean to include items that repeat across pages, like navigation links or banners.

	The `main` tag also has an embedded landmark feature that assistive technology can use to quickly navigate to the main content. If we've have ever seen a "Jump to Main Content" link at the top of a page, using a main tag automatically gives assistive device that functionality.
