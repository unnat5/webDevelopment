<!-- 
Visual Design in web development is a broad topic. It combines typography, color theory, graphics, animation, and page layout to help deliver a site's message. The definition of good design is a well-discussed subject, with many books on the theme.

At a basic level, most web content provides a user with information. The visual design of the page can influence its presentation and a user's experience. In web development, HTML gives structure and semantics to a page's content, and CSS controls the layout and appearance of it.

This section covers some of the basic tools developers use to create their own visual designs.
 -->

<!--
	This section of the curriculum focuses on Applied Visual Design. The first groupd of challenges build on the given card layout to show a number of core principles.

	Text is often a large  part of web content. CSS has several options for how to align it with the `text-align` property.

	`text-align: justify;` causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box.

	`text-align: center;` centers the text

	`text-align: right;` right-aligns the text
	
	And `text-align: left;` (the default) left-aligns the text.

 -->
 <!-- ## Adjust the Width of an element using the width property

 We can specify the width of an element using the `width` property in CSS. Values can be given in relative length units (such as em), absolute length units (such as px), or as a percentage of its containing parent element. Here's an example that changes the width of an image to 220px:

 ```
 img {
	width: 220px;
 }
 ``` 


  -->
<!-- ## Adjust the Height of an element using height property

We can specify the height of an element using the `height` property in CSS, similar to the `width` property. Here's an example that changes the height of an image to 20px:
```
img {
	height: 20px
} 
```
-->
<!-- ## Use the strong Tag to make text bold

To make text bold, you can use the strong tag. This is often used to draw attention to text and symbolize that it is important. With the strong tag, the browser applies the CSS of `font-weight: bold;` to the element.  
-->

<!-- ## Use the u Tag to underline text

To underline text, you can use the u tag. This is often used to signify that a section of text is important, or something to remember. With the u tag, the browser applies the CSS of `text-decoration: underline;` to the element. 
-->

<!-- ## Use the em Tag to Italicize text

	To emphasize text, you can use the em tag. This displays text as italicized, as the browser applies the CSS of `font-style: italic;` to the element.
-->

<!--## Use the s tag to strikethrough text
To strikethrough text, which is when a horizontal line cuts across the characters, you can use the s tag. It shows that a section of text is no longer valid. With the s tag, the browser applies the CSS of `text-decoration: line-through;` to the element.
-->


<!-- ## Create a Horizontal line using the hr element

You can use the hr tag to add a horizontal line across the width of its containing element. This can be used to define a change in topic or to visually separate groups of content.  

-->
<!-- ## Adjust the background-color property of text
	Instead of adjusting our overall background or the color of the text to make the foreground easily readable, we can add a `background-color` to the element holding the text we want to emphasize. This challenge uses `rgba()` instead of `hex` codes or normal `rgb()`.

	```
	rgba stands for:
		r = red
		g=green
		b=blue
		a=alpha/level of opacity
	```

	The RGB values can range form 0 to 255. The alpha value can range from 1, which is fully opaque or a solid color, to 0, which is fully transparent or clear. `rgba()` is great to use in this case, as it allows you to adjust the opacity. This means you don't have to completely block out background.

	We'll use `background-color: rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.1)` for this challenge. It produce a darrk gray color that is nearly transparent given the low opacity value of 0.1. 
-->
<!-- ## Adjust the size of a Header versus a paragraph Tag

The font size of header tags (`h1` through `h6`) should generally be larger than the font size of paragraph tags. This makes it easier for the user to visually understand the layout and level of importance of everything on the page. We use the `font-size` property to adjust the size of the text in an element.  
-->

<!-- ## Add a box shadow to a Card like element

The `box-shadow` property applies one or more shadows to an element.

The box shadow property takes values for `offset-x`(how far to push the shadow horizontally from the element), `offset-y` (how far to push the shadow vertically from the element), `blur-radius`, `spread-radius` and a color value, in that order. The `blur-radius` and 	`spread-radius` values are optional.

Here's an example of the CSS to create multiple shadows with some blur, at mostly-transparent black colors:

```
box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.19), 0 6px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.23);
``` 
-->

<!-- ## Decrease the Opacity of an Element
The `opacity` property in CSS is used to adjust the opacity, or conversely, the transparency for an item.

```
A value of 1 is opaque, which isn't transparent at all.
A value of 0.5 is half see-through.
A value of 0 is completely transparent.

```

The value given will apply to the entire element, whether that's an image with some transparency, or the foreground and background colors for a block of text.  

-->

<!--## Use the text-transform property to make text uppercase

	The `text-transform` property in CSS is used to change the appearance of text. It's a convenient way to make sure text on a webpage appears consistently, without having to change the text content of the actual HTML elements.


	The following table shows how the different `text-transform` values "Transform me"

	```
	lowercase: "transform me"

	uppercase: "TRANSFORM ME"

	capitalize: "Transform Me"

	initial: "use the default value"

	inherit: "Use the text-transform value from the parent element"

	none: Default: Use the original text
	```

-->

<!-- ## Set the font-size for multiple heading elements
	The font-size property is used to specify how large the text is in a given element. This rule can be used for multiple elements to create visual consistency of text on a page. In this challenge, you'll set the values for all h1 through h6 tags to balance the heading sizes.
-->

<!-- ## Set the line-height of Paragraphs

	CSS offers the `line-height` property to change the height of each line in a block of text. AS the name suggests, it changes the amount of vertical space that each line of text gets. 


-->

<!-- ## Adjust the Hover state of an anchor tag

	This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes. A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element.

	For example, the styling of an anchor tag can be changed for its hover state using the `:hover` pseudo-class selector. Here's the CSS to change the `color` of the anchor tag to red during its hover state:
	```
	a:hover{
		color:red;
	}
	``` 
-->

<!-- ## Change an Element's Relative Position

	CSS treats each HTML element as its own box, which is usually referred to as the `CSS Box Model`. Block-level items automatically start on a new line (think headings, paragraphs, and divs) while inline items sit within surrounding content (like images or spans). The default layout of elements in this way is called the `normal flow` of a document, but CSS offers the position property to override it.

	When the position of an element is set ot `relative`, it allows us to specify how CSS should move it relative to its current position in the normal flow of the page. It pairs with the CSS offset properties of `left` or `right`, and top` or `bottom`. These say how many pixels, percentages, or ems to move the items away from where it is normally positioned. The following example moves the paragraph 10 pixels away from the bottom:
	```
		p {
			position: relative;
			bottom: 10px;
		}
	```  
	Changing an element's position to relative does not remove it from the normal flow-other elements around it still behaves as if that item were in its default position.

	Note
	Positioning gives us a lot of flexibility and power over the visual layout of a page. It's good to remember that no matter the position of elements, the underlying HTML markup should be organized and make sense when read from top to bottom. This is how users with visual impairments (who rely on assistive devices like screen readers) access our content.
-->

<!-- ## Move a Relatively Positioned Element with CSS Offsets

	The CSS offsets of `top` or `bottom`, and `left` or `right` tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. We're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). As we saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the `h2` downwards. Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the right.  
-->

<!-- ##Lock an Element to its Parent with Absolute Positioning 
	
	The next option for the CSS `position` property is `absolute`, which locks the element in place relative to its parent container. Unlike the `relative` position, this removes the element from the normal flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it. The CSS offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust the position.

	One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closet positioned ancestor. If we forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using `position: relative;`), the browser will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag.  
-->

<!-- ## Lock an Element to the Browser Window with Fixed Positioning

The next layout scheme that CSS offers is the `fixed` position, which is a type of absolute positioning that locks ane element relative to the browser window. Similar to absolute postioning, it's used with the CSS offset properties and also removes the element from the normal flow of the document. Other items no longer "realize" where it is positioned, which may require some layout adjustments elsewhere.

One key difference between the `fixed` and `absolute` positions is that an element with a fixed position won't move when the user scrolls. 


-->

<!-- ## Push Elements Left or Right with the float property 

	The next positioning tool does not actually use `position`, but sets the `float` property of an element. Floating elements are removed from the normal flow of a document and pushed to either the `left` or `right` of  their containing parent element. It's commonly used with the `width` property to specify how much horizontal space the floated element requires.



-->


<!-- ## Change the Position of overlapping elements with z-index property

	When elements are positioned to overlap, the element coming later in the HTML markup will, by default, appear on the top of the other elements. However, the `z-index` property can specify the order of how elements are stacked on top of one another. It must be an iteger (i.e. a whole number and not a decimal), and higher values for the `z-index` property of an element move it higher in the stack than those with lower values.  
-->

<!-- ## Center an Element Horizontally using the margin property

Another positioning technique is to center a block of element horizontally. One way to do this is to set its `margin` to a value of auto.

This method works for images, too. Images are inline elements by default, but can be changed to block elements when we set the `display` property to block.

Center the `div` on the page by adding a `margin` property with a value of auto.  


-->

<!--  ## Learn about Complementary colors

	Color theory and its impact on design is a deep topic and only the basics are covered in the following challenges. On a website, color can draw attention to content, evoke emotions, or create visual harmony. Using different combinations of colors can really change the look of a website, and a lot of thought can go into picking a color palette that works with your content.

	The color wheel is a useful tool to visulaize how colors relate to each other - it's a circle where similar hues are neighbors and different hues are farther apart. When two colors are opposite each other on the wheel, they are called complementary colors. They have the characteristic that if they are combined, they "cancel" each other out and create a gray color. However, when placed side-by-side, these colors appear more vibrant and produce a strong visual contrast.  

	Some examples of complementary colors with their hex codes are:

	```
	red (#FF0000) and cyan (#00FFFF)
	green (#00FF00) and magenta (#FF00FF)
	blue (#0000FF) and yellow (#FFFF00)

	```
This is different than the outdated RYB color model that many of us were taught in school, which has different primary and complementary colors. Modern color theory uses the additive RGB model (like on a computer screen) and the subtractive CMY(K) model (like in printing). Read here for more information on this complex subject.

There are many color picking tools available online that have an option to find the complement of a color.
-->


<!-- ##Learn about Tertiary Colors
Computer monitors and device screens create different colors by combining amount of red, green, and blue light. This is known as RGB additive color model in modern color theory. Red(R), green(G), and blue (B) are called primary colors. Mixing two primary colors creates the secondary colors cyan (G+B), mangeta(R+B) and yellow (R+G). We saw these colors in the Complementary colors challenge. These secondary colors happens to be the complement to the primary color not used in their creation, and are opposite to that primary color on the color wheel. For example, mangenta is made with red and blue, and is the complement to green.

Tertiary colors are the result of the combining a primary color with ont of its secondary color neighbors. For example, red(primary) and yellow (secondary) make orange. This adds six more colors to a simple color wheel for a total of twelve.

There are various methods of selecting different colors that result in a hormonious combination in design. One example that can use tertiary colors is called the split-complementary color scheme. This scheme starts with a base color, then pairs it with the two colors that are adjacent to tis complement. The three colors provided stronf visual contrast in a design, but are more subtle than using two complementary colors.

Here are three colors created using split-complement scheme:

```
orange: #FF7D00
cyan: #00ffff
raspberry: #ff007d
