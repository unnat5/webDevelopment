 <!--  ##Create a more complex shape using CSS and HTML
  One of the most popular shapes in the world is heart shape, and in this challenge we'll create one using pure CSS. But first, we need to understand the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements. These pseudo-elements are used to add something something before or after a selected element. In the following example, a `::before` pseudo-element is used to add a rectangle to an element with the class `heart`:

  ```
    .heart::before {
      content: "";
      background-color:yellow;
      border-radius:25%;
      position: absolute;
      height: 50px;
      width: 70px;
      top: -50px;
      left: 5px;
    }

    For the `::before` and '::after' pseudo-elements to function properly, they must have a defined `content` property. This property is usually used to add things like a photo or text to the selected element. When the `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements are used to make shapes, the content property is still required, but it's set to an empty string.

    In the above example, the element with the class of heart has a ::before pseudo-element that produces a yellow rectangle with height and width of 50px and 70px, respectively. This rectangle has round corners due to its 25% border radius and is positioned absolutely at 5px from the left and 50px above the top of the element.

<!--  ## Applied Visual Design: Learn How the CSS @keyframes and animation properties work
  To animate an element, we need to know about the animation properties and the `@keyframe` rule controls what happens during that animation properties in total. This challenge will keep it simple and cover the two most important one first:

  `animation-name` sets the name of the animation, which is later used by `@keyframes` to tell CSS which rules go with which animations.


  `animation-duration` sets the length of time for the animation.

  `@keyframes` is how to specify exactly what happes within the animation over the duration. This done by giving CSS properties for specific "frames" during the animation, with percentages ranging from 0% to 100%. If we compare this to a movie, the CSS properties for 0% is how the element displays in the opening scene. The CSS properties for 100% is how the element appears at the end, right before the credits roll. Then CSS appliesthe magic transition the element over given duration to act out the scene. Here's an example to illustrate the usage of `@keyframes` and the animation properties:

  ```
    #anim {
      animation-name: colorful;
      animation-duration: 3s;
    }
    @keyframes colorful {
        0% {
          background-color: blue;
        }
        100 % {
          background-color: yellow;
        }
    }
  ``` 

  For the element with the `anim` id, the code snippet above sets the `animation-name` to `colorful` and sets the `animation-duration` to 3 seconds. Then the `@keyframes` rule links to the animation properties with the name `colorful`. It sets the color to blue at the beginning of the animation (0%) which will transition to yellow by the end of the animation (100%). You aren't limited to only beginning-end transitions, you can set properties for the element for any percentage between 0% and 100%.

<!--  ## Use css animation to change the hover state of a button
  We can use CSS `@keyframes` to change the color of a button in its hover state.

  Here's an example of changing the width of an image on hover:
  ```
  <style>
    img:hover{
      animation-name: width;
      animation-duration: 500ms;
    }
    @keyframes width{
      100%{
        width:40px;
      }
    }
    </style>

    <img src="https://bit.ly/smallgooglelogo" alt="Google's Logo" />
  ```
Note that ms stands for milliseconds, where 1000ms is equal to 1s.
-->

<!--  ## Modify Fill Mode of an Animation
  That's great, but it doesn't work right yet.Notice how the animation resets after `500ms` has passed, causing the button to revert back to the original color. We want the button to stay highlighted.

  This can be done by setting the `animation-fill-mode` property to `forwars`. The `animation-fill-mode` specifies the style applied to an element when the animation has finished. We can set it like so:

-->


<!--  ## Create Movement using CSS Animation
  When elements have a specified `position`, such as `fixed` or `relative`, the CSS offset properties `right`,`left`,`top`, and `bottom` can be used in animation rules to create movement.

  As shown in the example below, we can push the item downwards then upwards by setting the `top` property to the `50%` keyframe to 50px, but having it set to 0px for the first (`0%`)amd the last (`100%`) keyframe.

  ```
  @keyframes rainbow {
    0% {
        background-color: blue;
        top: 0px;
    }

    50% {
      background-color: green;
      top: 50px;
    }

    100% {
      background-color: yellow;
      top: 0px;
    }
  }
  ```

-->

<!--  ## Create Visual Direction by fading an element from left to right

  For this challenge, we'll change the `opacity` of an animated element so it gradually fades as it reaches the right side of the screen

  In the displayed animation, the round element with the gradient background moves to the right by the 50% mark of the animation per the `@keyframes` rule.

-->

<!-- ##Animate Elements Continually using an infinite animation count 
  The previous challenges covered how to use some of the animation properties and the `@keyframes` rule. Another animation property is the `animation-iteration-count`,which allows us to control how many times we would like to loop through the animation. Here's an example:

  ```
    animation-iteration-count: 3;
  ```
  In this case the animation will stop after running 3 times, but it's possible to make the animation run continuously by setting that value to infinite.
