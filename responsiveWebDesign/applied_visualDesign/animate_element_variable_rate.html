<!-- ## Animate Elements at variable rates
	There are a variety of ways to alter the animation rates of similarly animated elements. So far, this has been achieved by applying an animation-iteration-count property and setting @keyframes rules.

	To illustrate, the animation on the right consists of two "stars" that each decrease in size and opacity at the 20% mark in the @keyframes rule, which creates the twinkle animation. You can change the @keyframes rule for one of the elements so the stars twinkle at different rates.

  <!-- ## Applied Visual Design: Animate multiple element at varibale rates
	In the previous challenge, you changed the animation rates for two similarly animated elements by altering their @keyframes rules. You can achieve the same goal by manipulating the animation-duration of multiple elements.


	In the animation running in the code editor, there are three "stars" in the sky that twinkle at the same rate on a continuous loop. To make them twinkle at different rates, you can set the `animation-duration` property to different values for each element.

	@keyframes twinkle-1{
